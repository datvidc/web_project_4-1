### Overview

- Details
- Figma
- Images

**Details**
"Around The U.S." is an interactive page where users can add, remove, or like photos. It was created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The CSS is formatted according to the CSS BEM Nested File Structure and the entire project is bundled with webpack. [Here is the published project](https://julieg18.github.io/web_project_4/)

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Have fun with JavaScript!
